# Rock Paper Scissors

A fun and interactive **Rock, Paper, Scissors** game implemented in Python! Play against the computer and see who wins.

## Features
- Fully interactive game.
- Includes visual ASCII art for rock, paper, and scissors.
- Simple and intuitive user interface.
- Compete with Computer.

## How to Play
1. Run the script.
2. Choose your move: Rock (0), Paper (1), or Scissors (2).
3. The computer will randomly pick its move.
4. The winner is determined based on classic rules:
   - Rock beats Scissors.
   - Scissors beats Paper.
   - Paper beats Rock.
   - If both human and computer choose the same, then its a Draw.

## Implementation

In this small Python project, I have made use of a module in Python 'Random' for computer to choose between Rock, Paper and Scissor and play the game. I have added some visual ASCII arts to make the game more fun and interactive. Simple data structure 'List' is used in the implementation of this program.
